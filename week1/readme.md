# Auto Kiln Ventor

## Simple Overview:
This is a device that gradually opens the lid to a ceramic kiln after it is finished firing and alerts the user with a loud noise. This is something that I wished the kiln could do itself.

## Detailed Overview:
I imagine this device to be an accessory to an old kiln my family owned while I was growing up. The device will start once the kiln has finished firing, which will be after a set amount of hours have passed. The device will monitor the temperature outside and inside the kiln and use the information to slowly open the lid of a kiln. Once the task is complete it will emit a loud noise to notify the user.

## Background on the idea:
While I was growing up, my family had a kiln for firing ceramics. With it, we could make charms, necklaces, flutes, and pottery. Despite the buttons and knobs, the kiln was an old device and required the user to adjust settings at certain hours. One such task was that after each fire, the lid would have to be propped open to release the heat and cool the pottery. If we did this too early, the day was too cold, or was too quickly, then this would lead to the ceramics shattering and possibly sending shards flying. One or more family members would have to  periodically check the contents of the kiln over the next few hours and adjust the prop accordingly. This is something I wished as a kid that the device could do itself.
